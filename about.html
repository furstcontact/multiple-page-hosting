        A croissant is a French pastry, shaped like a crescent moon, that is
        made from a laminated yeast dough. It's known for its flaky and buttery
        texture, achieved through a process of layering butter into the dough.
        Croissants are typically eaten for breakfast or as a snack. Laminated
        Dough: The defining characteristic of a croissant is its laminated
        dough. This involves repeatedly rolling and folding the dough with
        layers of butter, creating multiple thin layers that result in a flaky
        texture when baked. Yeast-Leavened: Unlike puff pastry, croissant dough
        contains yeast, which contributes to its lighter, airy texture.

            The croissant as we know it today was popularized in France in the 19th
            century. It is said that Viennese baker Sylvain Cla foutier introduced
            the kipferl to France after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire
