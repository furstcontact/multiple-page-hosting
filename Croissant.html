      Across various accounts of croissant history, most sources agree that it
      originates from Austria as the kipferl. Made from a yeasted wheat dough,
      the kipferl is a baked bread roll common in Central Europe. Records state
      that the kipferl has been around as early as the 13th century, but many
      believe it may be even older
